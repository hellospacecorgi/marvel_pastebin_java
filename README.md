## How to run application

#### Configuration file for API keys

Marker's own API keys for both input and output APIs should be placed in the configuration JSON file `KeyConfig.json` under `src/main/resources/marvel` in order for the live versions to run.

NOTE: For Marvel API, **both public and private keys** need to be provided.

#### Gradle command

Option to use live or dummpy versions of both the input and output APIs can be selected with 2 arguments in sequence, where the first specifies for the input API and the second for the output API.

For example,

`gradle run --args="offline online"`

will run the application using offline (dummy) input API and live (requests hitting the web) output API.

`gradle run --args="online offline"`

will run the application using  live (requests hitting the web) input API and offline (dummy) output API.
