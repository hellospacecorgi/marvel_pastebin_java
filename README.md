## Assigned APIs

Input: https://developer.marvel.com/ Output: https://pastebin.com/doc_api

---

## How to run application

#### Configuration file for API keys

Marker's own API keys for both input and output APIs should be placed in the configuration JSON file `KeyConfig.json` under `src/main/resources/marvel` in order for the live versions to run.

Replace API keys as JSON strings in the following fields as annotated

```
{
"marvelKey": "<Marvel API public key>",
"marvelPrivateKey": "<Marvel API private key>",
"pastebinKey" : "<Pastebin API public key>"
}
```

NOTE: For Marvel API, **both public and private keys** need to be provided.

#### Gradle command

Option to use live or dummy versions of both the input and output APIs can be selected with 2 arguments in sequence, where the first specifies for the input API and the second for the output API.

For example,

`gradle run --args="offline online"`

will run the application using offline (dummy) input API and live (requests hitting the web) output API.

`gradle run --args="online offline"`

will run the application using  live (requests hitting the web) input API and offline (dummy) output API.

## Feature claim
### PASS requirements feature set

- Given specified Marvel character name, display information about it (information on character, including image) on GUI in a way that would be useful to a user

- Produce report related to character information entity built from input Marvel API for output Pastebin API

The version where this is fully completed and tested in tagged with version `v1.2.2`.

### CREDIT requirements feature set

- Cache feature: The input model will automatically cache the JSON response body from a successful character data search request.

- MarvelCache.sqlite is a database with a Character table that has 2 columns "Name" and "Response" which is a key-value pair for caching search strings and their response strings.

- If the user hit search with a text in the text field that corresponds to a cached record, application will ask the user for option to load from cache or hit search again to request data from API.

- Both the online and offline input API models can save and load from cache, valid response saved in a previous session can be loaded in a offline version, and dummy response cached in a offline search will overwrite valid data from a previous live session.

The version where this is fully completed and tested in tagged with version `v1.3`.

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Commits

Note to marker: 
<p>1. <b>Pass set 1-7</b> lists commits in early development stages, while there was effort to keep track of TDD through commit messages, commit history was unfortunately messy and require looking into files to compare changes (For example, ModelImplTest file might show up as modified but the change was done to a test method that is different to the ones added in the RED stage), to make marking easier I have added <b>commit comments</b> on the sets and individual commits to explain</p>

<p>1.2. Some RED-GREEN processes were submerged within a commit (as a mistake of not correctly tracking RED-GREEN-RED-GREEN-REFACTORs where modification to existing tests were done before refactoring), after consulting Josh, it was adviced to still list them. </p>
  
<p>3. <b>Pass set 6-10 and credit set 1-3</b> are much cleaner commits.</p>

**REFACTOR** Commit URL: <a href="https://github.sydney.edu.au/hcha8985/SCD2_2021_Exam/commit/51a4911b7c30bc9abda1a68a2a6916472e788b07">51a4911b7c30bc9abda1a68a2a6916472e788b07</a>

Modification to how MarvelApiHandler's access to public and private keys were done,
from setApiKeys to setting keys by Constructor arguments.

MarvelApiHandler constructor is refactored, uses injected strings to set keys rather than hard coded strings.

This leads to modification in method call inside ModelImpl to setApiHandler for input model, ModelImpl's line 29.

Tests for InputModel still passes after this refactoring (interaction between OnlineMarvelModel and MarvelApiHandler still behaves as before).
